Objective:
 The project requires a database that stores player information as well as player  statistics (such as goals, assists, expected goals, expected assists, progressive carries, progressive passes, shots saved etc). This data is primarily for data analysis to gain insights on potential new signings based on club's business needs.

*  Database will fit a Online Analytical Processing system (OLAP)
	1. Will be optimized for query performance (read heavy tasks)
		a. A player stats table will introduce null values for attributes these players cannot have(i.e. goal keeper with progressive carries or striker with shots save)
	2. Will be normalized; no duplication of data, each record linked to unique FKs(composite key)

*   Will be a wide table
